#Warshall algorithm
# Graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and E a set of edges, connecting  a pair of vertices
# u an v vertices are adjacent, if edge r connects them, r = uv. In this case u and v are the endpoints of edge r.
# if vertex v is an endpoint of edge r, then v and r are incident
